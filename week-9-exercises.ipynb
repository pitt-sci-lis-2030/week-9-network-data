    "**Q1** The Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) has an API that allows you to programmatically access information about their collection. In order to access their API, you must have an *API KEY*. Read the [DPLA Developers Policy on API keys](https://pro.dp.la/developers/policies#get-a-key) for instructions on how to request an API key. In this exercise, you are going to use Python to *request* an API key to be sent to your email address. You will use this API key in Q2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps for accessing the DPLA API:\n",
    "1. Review the [DPLA Documentation](https://pro.dp.la/developers/policies#get-a-key) \n",
    "2. Using the `requests` Python library, make an appropirate HTTP request type to the proper URL.\n",
    "    * Review the [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/quickstart/) library for how to make different kinds of requests.\n",
    "3. Print the response received from the request.\n",
    "4. Check your email to see if you got an API key. It should be a long string of characters and numbers that looks like `389fecd655b4c95532179f4337e50c84`\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Hint** Pay attention to the HTTP request METHOD and make sure to include your email in the appropriate part of the URL."

    "In this question, you are going to use the API key you created in question 1 to search the library using Python. Read the DPLA documentation on [API Basics](https://pro.dp.la/developers/api-basics), [making requests](https://pro.dp.la/developers/requests), and what [responses look like](https://pro.dp.la/developers/responses). Reading documentation is crucial for using APIs because they provide the instructions for how to access the API and the shape of the data you will get in response. \n",

    "* Published before 2020\n",

    "Think about the URL for searching *items* and the HTTP parameters for the query. Refer to the [simple search](https://pro.dp.la/developers/requests#simple) and [temporal search](https://pro.dp.la/developers/requests#temporal) documentation for helping.\n",

    "The results will include a TON of information. Refer to the DPLA's [Object Structure](https://pro.dp.la/developers/object-structure) documentation to see a human readable represntation of the results. To make things simple, lets just print the [`isShownAt`](https://pro.dp.la/developers/field-reference#isShownAt) field for each of the results. This means reaching into the response JSON, finding the list of results, and looping over just those pieces of data. This will be a list of URLs that you can visit to see the items in their home collections.\n",
